# Week 00 - Example Workflow

1. Solution compiled with `g++ src/solution.cpp -o solution` to give a `./solution` executable
2. "./solution" written as the command in `SOLUTION_COMMAND`
3. Run `python test.py` to execute the command in `SOLUTION_COMMAND` on the test suite
4. Tests fail, iterate!
5. Tests pass, yay!
